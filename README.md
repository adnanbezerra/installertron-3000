##  :clipboard: Description

I hate when I have to configure a new computer after a Linux fresh install. I absolutely hate it. That's why I've decided to create an autoconfigurator to do this for me. Now, I only have to code this small project and never again worry about anything. That's marvelous. Programming is my passion.

Some will complain that I made it using Node.JS instead of pure Bash, creating those super cool UI on the command line like a true gigachad. To those, I must say that I am sorry, but yes, it's made with Node. One day, when I become gigachad, I may translate it to another language.

So, even though it's a program for autoconfiguration of your computer, you must configure Node.JS. You can just copy and past this on your computer:

``` bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc

nvm install --lts
```
